    If revealed is 0


Reveal starting cell.
If 0, reveal surrounding cells.
While any new cells revealed are 0, continue.

var q = [];
q.push(startCell);
while (q.length > 0) {
    var currCell =  q.shift();
    reveal(currCell);
    if currCell == 0,
        q.push(surroundingUnopenedCells); - make function that adds unopened adjacent cells to queue.
